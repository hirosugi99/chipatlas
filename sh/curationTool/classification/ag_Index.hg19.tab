This protein binds as a homodimer to the cAMP-responsive element, an octameric palindrome. The protein is phosphorylated by several protein kinases, and induces transcription of genes in response to hormonal stimulation of the cAMP pathway.  Alternate splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

Max|sc-197|The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family of transcription factors. It is able to form homodimers and heterodimers with other family members, which include Mad, Mxi1 and Myc. Myc is an oncoprotein implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The homodimers and heterodimers compete for a common DNA target site (the E box) and rearrangement among these dimer forms provides a complex system of transcriptional regulation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene but the full-length nature for some of them is unknown (RefSeq).|Rabbit polyclonal IgG, epitope mapping at the C-terminus of Max of human origin.

CEBPB_(SC-150)|sc-150|The protein encoded by this intronless gene is a bZIP transcription factor which can bind as a homodimer to certain DNA regulatory regions.

The encoded protein is important in the regulation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses and has been shown to bind to the IL-1 response element in the IL-6 gene, as well as to regulatory regions of several acute-phase and cytokine genes.  In addition, the encoded protein can bind the promoter and upstream element and stimulate the expression of the collagen type I gene (provided by RefSeq).|Rabbit polyclonal IgG, epitope mapping at the C-terminus of CEBPB of rat origin.

This encoded protein is expressed in many tissues, among them skeletal muscle, thymus, B- and T-cells, and may participate in regulating lineage-specific gene expression through the formation of heterodimers with other bHLH E-proteins. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.|HEB (A-20) Rabbit polyclonal IgG, 200 ?g/ml.

Egr-1|sc-110|Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3 and Egr-4 are nuclear transcription factors belonging to the Egr C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family and containing three C2H2-type zinc fingers. As immediate early proteins, Egr transcription factors are rapidly induced by diverse extracellular stimuli. Egr proteins are subject to tight differential control through diverse mechanisms at several levels of regulation including transcriptional, translational and post-translational (including glyco- sylation, phosphorylation and redox) mechanisms and protein-protein inter- action. Egr-1 binds to the DNA sequence 5'-CGCCCCCGC-3' (EGR-site), there- by activating transcription of target genes whose products are required for mitogenisis and differentiation. Egr-2 binds specific DNA sites located in the promoter region of HoxA4. Egr-2 defects cause congenital hypomyelination neuropathy (also designated Charcot-Marie-tooth disease) and Dejerine- Sottas neuropathology (also designated hereditary motor and sensory neuro- pathy III. Egr-3 is involved in muscle spindle development and is expressed in T cells 20 minutes following activation. EGR-4 binds to the EGR consensus motif GCGTGGGCG, functions as a transcriptional repressor, and displays autoregulatory activities, downregulating its on gene promoter in a dose dependent manner.|Rabbit polyclonal, EGR-1 (588). Antibody Target: EGR1	Oth@ EGR1
USF-1|sc-229|The ubiquitously expressed cellular upstream stimulatory factor (USF) consists of USF-1 and USF-2 polypeptides which independently exhibit site-specific DNA binding and are members of the c-Myc-related family of regulatory factors containing helix-loop-helix domains. USF also contains a leucine repeat that is required for efficient DNA binding. USF was originally identified as an up- stream stimulatory factor that binds the core sequence CACGTG in the adeno- virus late promoter. These findings, together with the demonstration of coop- erative interaction between USF and the initiator-binding protein, TFII-I, raises the possibility of a more general involvement of USF in transcriptional regula- tion. While expression of both USF-1 and USF-2 species is ubiquitous, different ratios of USF homo- and heterodimers are found in different cell types.|Rabbit polyclonal, USF-1 (C-20).

The gene is often involved in the translocation with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Extensive alternative splicing of this gene results in several variations of the protein's central and C-terminal regions; all variants encode the same N-terminus. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

NR2F2_(SC-271940)|sc-271940|This gene encodes a member of the steroid thyroid hormone superfamily of nuclear receptors. The encoded protein is a ligand inducible transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of many different genes. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

It can also form heterodimers with the related protein CEBP-alpha. The encoded protein is important in the regulation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, and may be involved in the regulation of genes associated with activation and/or differentiation of macrophages. The cytogenetic location of this locus has been reported as both 8p11 and 8q11 (provided by RefSeq).|Rabbit polyclonal IgG, epitope mapping at the C-terminus of CEBPD of human origin.

E2F6|sc-22823|This gene encodes a member of the E2F transcription factor protein family. E2F family members play a crucial role in control of the cell cycle and of the action of tumor suppressor proteins. They are also a target of the transforming proteins of small DNA tumor viruses. Many E2F proteins contain several evolutionarily conserved domains: a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain. The encoded protein of this gene is atypical because it lacks the transactivation and tumor suppressor protein association domains. It contains a modular suppression domain and is an inhibitor of E2F-dependent transcription. The protein is part of a multimeric protein complex that contains a histone methyltransferase and the transcription factors Mga and Max. Multiple transcript variants have been reported for this gene, but it has not been clearly demonstrated that they encode valid isoforms (RefSeq).|Rabbit polyclonal IgG, epitope corresponding to a.a. 232-281 mapping at the C-terminus of E2F-6 of human origin.

STAT5A_(SC-74442)|sc-74442|The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated by, and mediates the responses of many cell ligands, such as IL2, IL3, IL7 GM-CSF, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and different growth hormones. Activation of this protein in myeloma and lymphoma associated with a TEL/JAK2 gene fusion is independent of cell stimulus and has been shown to be essential for the tumorigenesis. The mouse counterpart of this gene is found to induce the expression of BCL2L1/BCL-X(L), which suggests the antiapoptotic function of this gene in cells.

Estrogen and its receptors are essential for sexual development and reproductive function, but also play a role in other tissues such as bone. Estrogen receptors are also involved in pathological processes including breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and osteoporosis. Alternative splicing results in several transcript variants, which differ in their 5-prime UTRs and use different promoters. (provided by RefSeq)|Rabbit affinity purified polyclonal antibody.

The protein is also a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that specifically acetylates histones H2B and H4 in vitro; thus it may represent a class of sequence-specific factors that activate transcription by direct effects on chromatin components. Additional transcript variants have been identified but their biological validity has not been determined.

sc-229|The ubiquitously expressed cellular upstream stimulatory factor (USF) consists of USF-1 and USF-2 polypeptides which independently exhibit site-specific DNA binding and are members of the c-Myc-related family of regulatory factors containing helix-loop-helix domains. USF also contains a leucine repeat that is required for efficient DNA binding. USF was originally identified as an up- stream stimulatory factor that binds the core sequence CACGTG in the adeno- virus late promoter. These findings, together with the demonstration of coop- erative interaction between USF and the initiator-binding protein, TFII-I, raises the possibility of a more general involvement of USF in transcriptional regula- tion. While expression of both USF-1 and USF-2 species is ubiquitous, different ratios of USF homo- and heterodimers are found in different cell types.|Rabbit polyclonal, USF-1 (C-20).

CTCF_(SC-15914)|sc-15914|Transcriptional regulator with 11 highly conserved zinc finger domains. Depending on context, can bind a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-containing complex and function as transcriptional activator or bind a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-containing complex and function as transcriptional repressor. Involved in transcriptional regulation by binding to chromatin insulators and preventing interaction between promoter and nearby enhancers and silencers. Preferentially interacts with unmethylated DNA, preventing spreading of CpG methylation. Can dimerize, mediating long-range chromatin looping. When bound to chromatin, provides an anchor point for nucleosomes positioning. Involved in sister chromatid cohesion. Associates with both centromeres and chromosomal arms during metaphase and required for cohesin localization to CTCF sites.|Goat polyclonal, epitope mapping near the C-terminus of CTCF of human origin.

CDP_(sc-6327)|sc-6327|CDP (for CCAAT displacement protein) was identified as a repressor for tran- scription of developmentally regulated genes. It is a homeodomain protein that appears to compete with transcriptional activating proteins for binding to the promoter regions of various genes. CDP contains three cut repeats which function as DNA binding domains. It has been demonstrated that cut repeat domains have the capacity to bind to DNA in conjunction with or independently of homeodomain DNA binding. CDP has been shown to be the DNA-binding subunit of the HiNF-D complex, which contains cyclin A, Cdc2 and an Rb-related protein in addition to CDP. Histone expression is required for the transition to S phase in the cell cycle. The HiNF-D complex regulates the transcription of Histone H4, H3 and H1 genes, allowing cells to progress from G1 to S phase.|CDP (C-20) is an affinity purified goat polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the C-terminus of CDP of mouse origin.|GM12878	Oth@ CUX1

ZNF384_(HPA004051)|HPA004051|This gene encodes a C2H2-type zinc finger protein, which may function as a transcription factor. This gene also contains long CAG trinucleotide repeats that encode consecutive glutamine residues. The protein appears to bind and regulate the promoters of the extracellular matrix genes MMP1, MMP3, MMP7 and COL1A1. Studies in mouse suggest that nuclear matrix transcription factors (NP/NMP4) may be part of a general mechanical pathway that couples cell construction and function during extracellular matrix remodeling. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Recurrent rearrangements of this gene with the Ewing's sarcoma gene, EWSR1 on chromosome 22, or with the TAF15 gene on chromosome 17, or with the TCF3 (E2A) gene on chromosome 19, have been observed in acute leukemia. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 7.|Rabbit polyclonal generated using the immunogen: Zinc finger protein 384 recombinant protein epitope signature tag (PrEST)|GM12878	Oth@ ZNF384

sc-229|The ubiquitously expressed cellular upstream stimulatory factor (USF) consists of USF-1 and USF-2 polypeptides which independently exhibit site-specific DNA binding and are members of the c-Myc-related family of regulatory factors containing helix-loop-helix domains. USF also contains a leucine repeat that is required for efficient DNA binding. USF was originally identified as an up- stream stimulatory factor that binds the core sequence CACGTG in the adeno- virus late promoter. These findings, together with the demonstration of coop- erative interaction between USF and the initiator-binding protein, TFII-I, raises the possibility of a more general involvement of USF in transcriptional regula- tion. While expression of both USF-1 and USF-2 species is ubiquitous, different ratios of USF homo- and heterodimers are found in different cell types.|Rabbit polyclonal, USF-1 (C-20).

HDAC2_(SC-6296)|sc-6296|This gene product belongs to the histone deacetylase family.  Histone deacetylases act via the formation of large multiprotein complexes, and are responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues at the N-terminal regions of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). This protein forms transcriptional repressor complexes by associating with many different proteins, including YY1, a mammalian zinc-finger transcription factor.

sc-185|This gene is a proto-oncogene candidate. It is identified by its translocation into the immunoglobulin alpha-locus in some cases of B-cell leukemia. The protein encoded by this gene contains seven ankyrin repeats, which are most closely related to those found in I kappa B proteins. This protein functions as a transcriptional co-activator that activates through its association with NF-kappa B homodimers. The expression of this gene can be induced by NF-kappa B, which forms a part of the autoregulatory loop that controls the nuclear residence of p50 NF-kappa B.
