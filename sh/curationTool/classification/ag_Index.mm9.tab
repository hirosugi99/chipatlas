MyoD_(sc-32758)|sc-32758|This gene encodes a nuclear protein that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors and the myogenic factors subfamily. It regulates muscle cell differentiation by inducing cell cycle arrest, a prerequisite for myogenic initiation. The protein is also involved in muscle regeneration. It activates its own transcription which may stabilize commitment to myogenesis.

MafK_(ab50322)|ab50322|NFE2 DNA-binding activity consists of a heterodimer containing an 18-kD Maf protein (MafF, MafG, or MafK) and p45. Both subunits are members of the activator protein-1 superfamily of basic leucine zipper (bZIP)proteins. Since they lack a putative transactivation domain, small Mafs behave as transcriptional repressors when they dimerize among themselves. They serve as transcriptional activators by dimerizing with other (usually larger) bZip proteins and recruiting them to specific DNA-binding sites.|Rabbit polyclonal.

CTCF_(SC-15914)|sc-15914|Transcriptional regulator with 11 highly conserved zinc finger domains. Depending on context, can bind a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-containing complex and function as transcriptional activator or bind a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-containing complex and function as transcriptional repressor. Involved in transcriptional regulation by binding to chromatin insulators and preventing interaction between promoter and nearby enhancers and silencers. Preferentially interacts with unmethylated DNA, preventing spreading of CpG methylation. Can dimerize, mediating long-range chromatin looping. When bound to chromatin, provides an anchor point for nucleosomes positioning. Involved in sister chromatid cohesion. Associates with both centromeres and chromosomal arms during metaphase and required for cohesin localization to CTCF sites.|Goat polyclonal, epitope mapping near the C-terminus of CTCF of human origin.

Max|sc-197|The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family of transcription factors. It is able to form homodimers and heterodimers with other family members, which include Mad, Mxi1 and Myc. Myc is an oncoprotein implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The homodimers and heterodimers compete for a common DNA target site (the E box) and rearrangement among these dimer forms provides a complex system of transcriptional regulation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene but the full-length nature for some of them is unknown (RefSeq).|Rabbit polyclonal IgG, epitope mapping at the C-terminus of Max of human origin.

USF-1|sc-229|The ubiquitously expressed cellular upstream stimulatory factor (USF) consists of USF-1 and USF-2 polypeptides which independently exhibit site-specific DNA binding and are members of the c-Myc-related family of regulatory factors containing helix-loop-helix domains. USF also contains a leucine repeat that is required for efficient DNA binding. USF was originally identified as an up- stream stimulatory factor that binds the core sequence CACGTG in the adeno- virus late promoter. These findings, together with the demonstration of coop- erative interaction between USF and the initiator-binding protein, TFII-I, raises the possibility of a more general involvement of USF in transcriptional regula- tion. While expression of both USF-1 and USF-2 species is ubiquitous, different ratios of USF homo- and heterodimers are found in different cell types.|Rabbit polyclonal, USF-1 (C-20).

MafK_(ab50322)|ab50322|NFE2 DNA-binding activity consists of a heterodimer containing an 18-kD Maf protein (MafF, MafG, or MafK) and p45. Both subunits are members of the activator protein-1 superfamily of basic leucine zipper (bZIP)proteins. Since they lack a putative transactivation domain, small Mafs behave as transcriptional repressors when they dimerize among themselves. They serve as transcriptional activators by dimerizing with other (usually larger) bZip proteins and recruiting them to specific DNA-binding sites.|Rabbit polyclonal.

The protein appears to bind and regulate the promoters of the extracellular matrix genes MMP1, MMP3, MMP7 and COL1A1. Studies in mouse suggest that nuclear matrix transcription factors (NP/NMP4) may be part of a general mechanical pathway that couples cell construction and function during extracellular matrix remodeling.
